Glad to see Twitter is failing... what a sad human being that is.

Deactivated Twitter today... not that I ever really used it. It would be nice if media companies would just stop covering it altogether. I mean, who really looks at a Twitter feed for anything anymore. We all just hear about someone tweeted this or see a meme made from a template that most likely isn't from a real post anyhow. Does anyone really _use_ twitter for it's intended purpose or do people just use it as a means for annoucing things and rely upon media to echo that back in our desired format?
